CTRCT1 includes congenital, zonular pulverulent, nuclear progressive, nuclear pulverulent, nuclear total, total, and posterior subcapsular types of cataract. Zonular or lamellar cataracts are opacities, broad or narrow, usually consisting of powdery white dots affecting only certain layers or zones between the cortex and nucleus of an otherwise clear lens. The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye."

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT3 includes congenital cerulean and sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities, among others. Cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities is characterized by white opacification around the anterior and posterior Y sutures, and grayish and bluish, spindle shaped, oval punctate and cerulean opacities of various sizes arranged in lamellar form. The spots are more concentrated towards the peripheral layers and do not delineate the embryonal or fetal nucleus.

This is a form of zonular cataract with an erect Y-shaped anterior and an inverted Y-shaped posterior sutural opacities. Zonular or lamellar cataracts are opacities, broad or narrow, usually consisting of powdery white dots affecting only certain layers or zones between the cortex and nucleus of an otherwise clear lens. The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes."

In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens.

"ATP2A2",http://purl.uniprot.org/diseases/1473,"DD","A skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp and forehead), palmoplantar pits and distinctive nail abnormalities. It is due to loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and abnormal keratinization. Patients with mild disease may have no more than a few scattered keratotic papules or subtle nail changes, whereas those with severe disease are handicapped by widespread malodorous keratotic plaques. Some patients present with hemorrhage into acantholytic vesicles on the palms and dorsal aspects of the fingers which gives rise to black macules. In a few families affected by Darier disease, neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as mild mental retardation, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and epilepsy have been reported. Stress, UV exposure, heat, sweat, friction and oral contraception exacerbate disease symptoms. Clinical variants of Darier disease include hypertrophic, vesicobullous, hypopigmented, cornifying, zosteriform or linear, acute and comedonal subtypes. Comedonal Darier disease is characterized by the coexistence of acne-like comedonal lesions with typical Darier hyperkeratotic papules on light-exposed areas. At histopathologic level, comedonal Darier disease differs from classic Darier disease in the prominent follicular involvement and the presence of greatly elongated dermal villi."

Patients are night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark-adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system. ERGs in response to single brief flashes of light have clearly detectable a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b-waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons. ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicate a markedly reduced on response and a nearly normal OFF response.

It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor."

Another skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility to infections, mainly affecting the respiratory system, primarily due to a chronic neutropenia and to neutrophil functional defects.

Most cases are sporadic, but families in which there is an autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease have been identified.
